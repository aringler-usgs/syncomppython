	  from his talk at the Earthscope Imaging Science/CIG Seismology
	  Joint Workshop on Computational Seismology.)

	  Got all the programs to build on my Linux system. I had to hunt
	  down xvertext-5.0 on the web to replace the missing "rotated.h".
	  Also, I whipped-up a replacement for the missing "leolib.col"
	  include file, based upon an examination of the surrounding
	  source. For now, I hard-coded the X11 link flags for 'curse'
	  (maybe there's a good Autoconf macro for this out there... or
	  not).
