==============================================================

NOTES for FORTRAN compilation.

Due to heavy computations in MINEOS package, it is recommended
to setup optimization option for FORTRAN compiler high as possible,
for example,

... > ./configure F77=g77 FFLAGS=-O2 --prefix=.....

for Linux/g77 compiler, or

... > ./configure F77=f77 FFLAGS=-fast --prefix=....

for SUN/f77 compiler.

Command make install creates directory bin for executable modules
and directory share for demo and testing MINEOS package.
Go to share directory after installation and follow README files.
