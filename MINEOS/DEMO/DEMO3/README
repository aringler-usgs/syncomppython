MINEOS DEMO run example.

This directory contains all necessary information to run a control
test for MINEOS package. To run the test, follow the instructions
below.

Step 1. Check that MINEOS binary programs are accessible via the PATH
        environment variable:

      ...> which minos_bran

Step 2. Start main script RUN_MINEOS.csh (for shell command interpreter)
        or RUN_MINEOS.sh (sh/bash command interpreter) with command

      ...> ./RUN_MINEOS.csh prem_noocean

      or 

      ...> ./RUN_MINEOS.sh prem_noocean

      RUN_MINEOS scripts runs minos_bran, eigcon, green and syndat
      MINEOS programs for a computation of the fundamental spheroidal and
      toroidal modes. The results are stored in test_S and test_T
      databases (eigenfunctions); in green database (Green functions);
      and in Syndat (synthetic seismograms).Files prem_noocean_S.
      prem_noocean_T, eprem_noocean_S and eprem_noocean_T are output
      of the minos_bran program.
      Compare results with precomputed ones in DEMO2 directory to be
      sure that everything works OK. Note that results in DEMO2
      had been computed on a SUN platform and binary files have
      BIG_ENDIAN order. 

Step 3. Convert synthetic seismograms to SAC format with command

      ...> cucss2sac Syndat Syndat_SAC
      
      SAC waveforms will be placed in the Syndat_SAC directory. If you 
      don't have sac program, skip this step.

Step 4. Convert synthetic seismograms to ASCII format with command

      ...> cucss2sac -a Syndat Syndat_ASC

      ASCII files will be placed in Syndat_ASC directory. Compare waveforms
      with waveforms in DEMO2/Syndat_ASC directory.

Step 5. If you have ANTELOPE software you may see the test results
       (Green functions and synthetic seismograms) directly on a SUN's 
       platform, for example,

      ...> dbpick Syndat
      or
      ...> dbpick grren

      Note that ANTELOPE is always required BIG_ENDIAN waveform data order.
      So, if test is running on a PC/Linux platform you need to convert 
      waveforms from LOW_ENDIAN bytes order to BIG_ENDIAN in the following way

      ...> RUN_ENDIAN.csh Syndat
      ...> RUN_ENDIAN.csh  green
    
      or in the case of SHELL environment
 
      ...> RUN_ENDIAN.sh Syndat
      ...> RUN_ENDIAN.sh  green

Step 6. Convert eigen functions (n=0,l=6,7,8) to ASCII format

      ...> eigen2asc 0 0 6 8 test_S test_S_ASC
 
      Converted ASCII files will be in test_S_ASC dir.
      Compare with files in DEMO2 dir.
